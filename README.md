# Supermarcat
Supermarcat is a pet food app that lets users customize cat food. It is targeted at users who want convenience as well as the ability to control what their pets are eating with a few simple taps.
The problem: There are no customizable pet food options for animals who require a certain diet.
The goal: Our goal is to give the user full control of what their pet eats all while being on your mobile phone. 
I conducted user interviews, utilized surveys and created empathy maps to understand the users I am designing for and their needs. A primary user group identified through research were pet owners who have pets that have specific dietary needs. The user group confirmed initial assumptions about potential users of a customizable pet food app, but research also revealed that specific dietary needs was not the only factor behind this idea. Other user problems included busy schedules, convenience, lack of transparency, difficulty of online ordering and product uncertainty.
